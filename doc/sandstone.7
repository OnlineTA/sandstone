sandstone \- user-space utilities for fine-grained, composable sandboxing
.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Terms
.I Sandboxing
is the virtualisation and confinement of operating-system(OS) resources in
support of executing unreliable code. The
.I art of sandboxing
entails letting unreliable code make use of OS resources, without letting it
.I abuse
the resources to unintended ends.

Sandboxing is
.I fine-grained
if tight limits can be imposed low-level OS resources. Sandboxing is
.I composable
if sandboxes can be further sandboxed.

Sandstone is designed for
.I fine-grained, composable sandboxing
\- it aims to be a collection of small, simple user-space utilities, composable
to form environments sandboxed to your hearts' content.
